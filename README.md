# SysAdmin
Linux System Administration fundamentals

In the project, we were presented with a scenario from a fictional company as if we were a Systems Administrator.  
We were then tasked with changing file permissions, creating/deleting users, and auditing the system via Lynis.

        Step 1: Ensure Permissions on Sensitive Files
        Step 2: Create User Accounts
        Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder
        Step 4: Lynis Auditing
        Bonus: chkrootkit
